# Origin

On the start of 2023, OpenHarmony masters on Bilibili ported OpenHarmony to [XiaoMi 6](https://space.bilibili.com/1570309) and [OnePlus 6T](https://space.bilibili.com/36549646) , and there is development on [OpenHarmony on PCs](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1DM411J7N3), we think that the development of OpenHarmony is destined to become an important part of localized technology in the future.

OpenHarmony is constently improving and perfecting. Starting from API9, it is starting to develop a complete application development system. However, too few open source software are created. We think one of the main reasons is that there are too few officially supported and third-party ports of the L3(Standard) system, or that they are too expensive. If there are no cheaper dev boards or other replacements (port for old phones), no developer will participate in the contribution of open source software, the OpenHarmony ecosystem would be still far from complete and lacking from competitors.

# Vision

- Invite more developers to actively participate in OHOS open source app development
- Enlarge OHOS's system and application's ecosystem and influence
- To let OHOS bloom in the future localized technology fields.
