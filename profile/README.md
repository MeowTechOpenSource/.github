# Origin

Looking forward to 2023, before the big guys at station B ported and adapted OpenHarmony for [XiaoMi 6](https://space.bilibili.com/1570309) and [OnePlus 6T](https://space.bilibili.com/36549646) , and later there will be [OpenHarmony on PCs](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1DM411J7N3) , perhaps the development of OpenHarmony is destined to become an important part of localized technology in the future.

- System development is constantly improving
- System adaptation continues
- Open source applications are few and far between

The third point, I think one of the main reasons is that there are too few standard system development boards that are officially supported and third-party ported and adapted, and the price is high. If there is no cheap development board or other alternatives (such as old mobile phone porting), no developer Contribute to open source software, so the entire ecology of OpenHarmony is still incomplete...

# Vision

- More people join and contribute to open source projects
- The system and application ecology are getting stronger and stronger
- Full bloom in the future coverage of localized technology
